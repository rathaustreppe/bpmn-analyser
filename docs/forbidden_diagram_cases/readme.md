# Forbidden Diagrams

There are some cases where BPMN is syntactically correct
but semantically ambiguous.
Additionally, there are cases that are hard to implement
and would drive the programmer crazy. We would fall short
of the KISS-principle. Luckily some cases can be converted
into easy-to-process-cases.

You can find all those forbidden diagrams (if existent their
solution) in the *.bpmn files in this folder. Best thing
is to open them with a BPMN-Viewer. There you can find
a problem description why this case is problematic.
